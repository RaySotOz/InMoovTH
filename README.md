<h1>Open source robotic arm INMOOV</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I used the open source robotic arm INMOOV, this one is used for robotic research and development. I made the mechanical adjustment to use it as a myoelectric prosthesis for amputees and for phocomelia disease. All the programming was done using Arduino and for the AI algorithm the Arduino board connects with Matlab to train the arm how to grasp objects as a human do.
